# TASK - 2
# Exploratory Data Analysis - Retail 

In this task, we will perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the 'SampleSuperstore' dataset, which can be found [here](https://bit.ly/3i4rbWl). The goal of this analysis is to identify any weak areas in the business where improvements can be made to increase profit.

## Task Deliverables

1. **Data Analysis:** Perform EDA on the 'SampleSuperstore' dataset using Power BI.

2. **Dashboard Creation:** Create a dashboard that displays the key findings from the data analysis. The dashboard should include visualizations that highlight any trends, patterns, or outliers in the data.

## Task Steps

1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Import the 'SampleSuperstore' dataset into Power BI.
   - Clean and preprocess the data as necessary.

2. **Data Analysis:**
   - Analyze the data to identify any trends, patterns, or outliers that could impact profitability.
   - Some potential business problems to explore include:
     - Which regions, categories, or sub-categories are the most/least profitable?
     - Are there any products that are selling well but have low profit margins?
     - Which sales channels are the most/least profitable?

3. **Dashboard Creation:**
   - You can find dashboard [Here](task-1(tsf).pbix) in same respository.

4. **Interpretation:**

## Tools Used

- Power BI

## Conclusion
 - West is the region with the highest Sum of Sales, which is 85.15% higher than South, the region with the lowest Sum of Sales. This indicates that West is the most profitable region for the company.</br>
 - West accounted for 31.59% of the Sum of Sales, which is a significant portion of the total sales.</br>
 - The Sum of Sales and Average of Sales diverged the most in the West region, indicating that there is a significant variation in sales within this region.</br>
 - The Sum of Sales and Sum of Profit varied significantly across the 49 states, indicating that there are differences in profitability across different states.</br>
 - The Technology category had the highest Average of Profit, indicating that this category is the most profitable for the company.</br>
 - The Office Supplies and Furniture categories also had positive Average of Profit, but they were lower than the Technology category.</br>
 - Overall, the report suggests that the company's sales and profitability vary significantly across different regions and categories. The West region and the Technology category appear to be the most profitable, while the South region and some states have lower sales and profitability. The company may want to focus on these areas to improve their overall profitability.

## Area of Improvement based on Conclusion provided
To boost performance in the identified weak areas, the following strategies are proposed:

1. **Increase Sales in the South Region**: Targeted marketing campaigns, improved product offerings, and discounts/promotions are recommended to boost sales in this underperforming region.

2. **Analyze Sales Variation in the West Region**: Detailed analysis of sales data by state, city, or product category is needed to understand the reasons behind the divergence between Sum of Sales and Average of Sales in this region.

3. **Improve Profitability in Less Profitable States**: Focus on cost structure analysis, cost reduction strategies, and better pricing tactics to enhance profitability in states where profits are low despite high sales.

4. **Increase Sales in Less Profitable Categories**: Strategies to increase sales in Office Supplies and Furniture categories should be implemented, such as improved product offerings, discounts/promotions, and targeted marketing to specific customer segments.

5. **Monitor Sales and Profitability Trends**: Continuous tracking and analysis of sales and profitability trends by month or quarter, including seasonal trends and customer behavior changes, to adjust strategies as necessary.

By addressing these areas, profitability and overall business performance can be improved.
